					<h3>About Eric Thomas</h3>

Through a significant social media presence and his recent domestic and international tours, “ET, The Hip Hop Preacher” has become a global phenomenon!</p>
					
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p> While the typical undergraduate student takes between four to six years to complete their studies, ET took 12.  For most, that would have signaled the end of any future academic aspirations.  For ET, it was a springboard from which his academic success would be launched!  In 2005, ET completed and received a Master’s Degree from Michigan State University and on February 5th of  2015, Eric successfully defended his dissertation and will receive his PhD in Education Administration on May 8th, 2015, from Michigan State University.</p>
					
					<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
					<p>As CEO of his Consulting Firm, ETA LLC., Eric has led his team through the doors of dozens of reputable organizations and Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric, Quicken Loans, AT&T, Nike, Under Armour, New Balance and UPS.  He has also consulted for major Universities and the major sports teams within the MLB, NBA, NFL and MLS.

					Eric’s spiritual walk, tenacity and drive are the perfect example of his quote,“When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you‘ll be successful.” At a  recent business meeting, Eric had the opportunity to learn more ‘Secrets of Success’ from Mr. Warren Buffett. This invitation-only event, broadened his mind and further strengthened his resolve to empower others in their pursuit of greatness.</p>
